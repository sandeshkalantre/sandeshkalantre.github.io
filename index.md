Hello friends! It seems you have stumbled on my homepage.

I a Knight-Hennessy fellow at Stanford University. I am part of the Goldhaber-Gordon Group at the Geballe Lab for Advanced Materials.

I am interested in all things quantum, especially when it is starkly manifested in the properties of materials. Besides, I like to program (computers!) and build things.

If I am not working, you can find me reading history or poetry, playing Age of Empires, watching sci-fi shows and movies or begin lost in classical music.

This is a typical property of my ground state!
