Hello friends! 

I'm currently a Knight-Hennessy fellow at Stanford University. I am part of the Goldhaber-Gordon Group at the Geballe Lab for Advanced Materials.

I am interested in all things quantum, especially when manifested in the properties of materials. I enjoy writing short snippets of code and building things.

If I am not working, you can find me reading history, politics or poetry, playing Age of Empires, watching sci-fi shows and movies or being lost in classical music.

This is a typical property of my ground state!
