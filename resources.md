This is a list of interesting resources I have found online and offline.

## Historical Anecdotes
- [Cargo Cult Science](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm) : Richard Feynman talks about scientific integrity - *The first principle is that you must not fool yourselfâ€”and you are the easiest person to fool*.

## Vim shortcuts
- spell check, run `setlocal spell`. To move cursor to the next misspelled word, use `]s` and `[s` for the previous misspelled word. If you want it to be always on, add `set spell` to .vimrc.

## FreeCAD tutorial
- [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBQazB0HUyTQkRkbD02DZqnlV6oBMhHB) I found a great introduction to FreeCAD, a completely free CAD software that is good replacement for Solidworks or Fusion 360.
