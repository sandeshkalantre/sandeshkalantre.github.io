(This is a small description of my visit to IIT Madras for the InterIIT Tech Meet.)

Going on Friday, back on Sunday; 3000 km to and fro. Once cannot forget how close the modern world in terms of travel time. I had decided to participate in the 6th InterIIT Technical Meeting at IIT Madras on  5th - 7th January 2018. I was in the group dealing with the Exoplanet detection problem using machine learning.

I left Mumbai on Friday afternoon to reached Chennai in the evening. This was my first visit to Chennai. As always, I decided to read a book on the flight. I choose the book ISRO : A Personal History by R. Amudanvan. Describing the most successful story from a bunch of enthusiastic youngsters in their 20s, to the creation of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), this book reaffirmed ideals about how anything worthwhile takes great time and effort. 

The InterIIT Tech meet was scheduled over a couple of days. On the first day, we had to give a presentation for our exoplanet problem. On the night of the first day, we had to participate in an all-night hackathon on celestial mechanics. This night brought back memories of me trying to learn programming in younger times to solve the three-body problem. We managed to solve the problem and gave in our results early morning. The walk back to the accommodation in the winter of Madras among the forests at IIT almost felt like a victory lap!

We managed to win a bronze medal in the competition. Yay!
