## (May 2020) Sun dogs and 22-degree halo
The following two photos were taken with an iPhone camera. This is not a rainbow for a couple of reasons: in a rainbow, the curvature-color correspondence is different, red is on the convex side. Also, rainbows have their center about the point opposite to the sun. Instead, I think this is a different phenomena called sun-dogs and the 22-degree halo, caused by hexagonal ice crystals in the clouds.
